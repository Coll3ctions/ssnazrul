SELECT t.state_name, SUM(cSale.customer_total) as Sales 
FROM sales.customer c, sales.state t, 
	(
	SELECT s.customer_id, SUM(s.price) as customer_total 
	FROM sales.sale s 
	GROUP BY s.customer_id
	) 
	cSale
WHERE cSale.customer_id = c.customer_id AND c.state_id = t.state_id
GROUP BY t.state_name
ORDER BY Sales DESC;  



3. Show the total sales for each product, for a given customer. Only products that were actually
bought by the given customer. Order by dollar value.

SELECT s.product_id, SUM(s.price) as Sales
FROM sales.sale s
WHERE s.customer_id = 1
GROUP BY s.product_id
ORDER BY sale DESC; 



4. Show the total sales for each product and customer. Order by dollar value.

SELECT  s.product_id, s.customer_id, SUM(s.price) as Sales
FROM sales.sale s
GROUP BY s.product_id, s.customer_id
ORDER BY sale ASC;



5. Show the total sales for each product category and state.

SELECT cu.state_id, c.category_id, SUM(s.price) as Sale
FROM sales.sale s, sales.category c, sales.product p, sales.customer cu
WHERE s.product_id = p.product_id 	
	AND p.category_id = c.category_id 
	AND s.customer_id = cu.customer_id
GROUP BY cu.state_id, c.category_id;



6. For each one of the top 20 product categories and top 20 customers, it returns a tuple (top
product, top customer, quantity sold, dollar value)

SELECT topCat.category_id, topCus.customer_id, topCus.quantity, topCus.c_total_sale
FROM
	(SELECT g.category_id, SUM(s.price) as g_total_sale
		FROM sales.sale s, sales.product p, sales.category g
		WHERE s.product_id = p.product_id AND p.category_id = g.category_id
		GROUP BY g.category_id
		ORDER BY g_total_sale DESC
		LIMIT 20) topCat,
	(SELECT s.customer_id, SUM(s.quantity) as quantity, SUM(s.price) as c_total_sale
		FROM sales.sale s
		GROUP BY s.customer_id
		ORDER BY c_total_sale DESC
		LIMIT 20) topCus;
